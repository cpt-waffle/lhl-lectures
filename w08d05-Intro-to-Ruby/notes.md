### Javascript JS

-- 10 days in 1995
-- Brendan Eich
-- Java was a popular language at the time, so they named it Javascript to capitalize on the fame!!
-- functional language
-- frontend / backend
-- low level 
-- insanely LARGE ecosystem of packages~!
-- its async language -- (callbacks, promises, async/wait)

### Ruby

-- created in 1995 
-- created "Matz" Yukihiro Matsumoto
-- popular in 2005, --- Ruby on Rails (ExpressJS)
-- class based 
-- high abstracted 
-- sync :(
-- performance issues that needs to patched/addressed/etc
-- fairly large ecosystem of packages (gems)

### Why are we even learning Ruby? its slow, its old, its not performant, why not learn language xyz??
