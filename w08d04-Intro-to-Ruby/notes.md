### Ruby vs JS

### JS

- 10 days in 1995
- JavaScript --- JAVA -- still confuses recruiters to this day :) 
- can both run in the front-end and back-end 
- the library for JS, is absolutely massive (1.4mill + )
- asynchronous (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- syntax inspired by C and Java
- Very active Communities!
- very easy(ish) and fun to learn

### Ruby

- created in 1995 
- Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz)
- got popular in 2008 because of a framework ( Ruby on Rails )
- "simplified" and "unclutered" 
- synchronous (lacks performance)
- (rails) very good for making things quick ( rapid prototyping)
- fairly big package libraries 
- established 



##### Next Week!
