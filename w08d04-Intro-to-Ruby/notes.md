## Comparison of JS to Ruby


### JS

-- 10 days in 1995
-- Brendon Eich 
-- Java was popular at the time, and they wanted the same popularity
-- functional language
-- Javascript on the front-end and back-end
-- highly performant
-- low level
-- INSANELY LARGE ecosystem of packages 
-- very active community
-- asynch

### Ruby  (ruby on rails <--  a framework thats "kind of" like express)

-- was created in 1995,  became popular in 2005 due to a framework release called Ruby on Rails
-- Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz)
-- it can only work on the backend 
-- "simplified" syntax
-- class based, everything in ruby is a class
-- highly abstracted, high level
-- performance issues 
-- big ecosystem 
-- established community
-- synch
