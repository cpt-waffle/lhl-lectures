## Comparisons

### JS - Javascript

- invented in 1995- 96 
- 10 days 
-  JavaSCRIPT, to piggy pack of java, (there isn't much simularity between JS and Java)
- async (callbacks, promises, async/await)
^ PERFORMANCE
- library in JS is HUUUUUUUUUUGE, (1.3 - 1.4 mill packages)
- very active communities 
- js is kinda easy to learn

### Ruby 

- invented in 1995
- Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz)
- 2008 -- Ruby on Rails 
- "simplified" and "unclutered"
- sync ( things that you see happen, in sequence )
LACKS PERFORMANCE ^ 
- (rails) its very good for making things quick (... as long as you follow its rules)
- big library (but 1.3 mil big....)
- established
