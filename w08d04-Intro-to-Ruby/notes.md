## Comparisons

### JS - Javascript

- 8 - 10 days invented javascript 1995 (Brendan Eich)
- javascript was named because of the success of JAVA
- async -- one main thread, and then things get pushed into the callback stack
- good performance
- npmjs.com 1.3 mill packages, very active community/communities
- syntax inspired by Java/C


### Ruby

- invented in 1995 
- Yukihiro Matsumoto -- Matz (perl)
- got popular in 2005-08 (Ruby on Rails)
- syntax simplified* and uncluttered*
- sync language (each line runs, then the next line runs, and on, and on)
- performance :( not great
- huge library of packages 
- comminity is slowly dropping but still some places are active 
- established community/language
