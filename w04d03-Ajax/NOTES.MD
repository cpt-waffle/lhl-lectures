Server <-------------------> HTML & JS 
                                we do some operations to get the content and load to the page!

AJAX

Microsoft 

"everyone at home, have these powerful computers, why cant we utelize their performance
"to render some pages?"

"why cant our servers send not the layout, but just the data? "

Servers that send out ONLY information: (No layout, no css, nothing pretty, just RAW INFO/CONTENT)
API's

I want to build an app that shows me recipies

-- i will sit with a cooking book, and enter all of the recipies manually
-- use an api ()

## Now We know APIs and We heard about AJAX, How do we actually GET THIS DATA INTO OUR APPS?
