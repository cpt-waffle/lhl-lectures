- Building an App with an API 


# -----------------  

TinyApp

EJS <-- View Engine --->

Browser can only work/use 2 types of files (HTML, JS)

SERVER                                                 CLIENT
      <--------------------REQ-------------------------
EJS (COMPILE IT TO HTML) -------------RES ------------->


SERVER SIDE RENDERING 


Microsoft ---- send alittle bit of data 
(no html
(no css)
(just data)

JSON 

APIs 

-- PAID API's 
-- FREE API's 


XML 

and then we make the client do anything with that data?
AJAX is a way to ask a server for JUST the data, and retreive it ( for HTML no refresh is nessesary )
