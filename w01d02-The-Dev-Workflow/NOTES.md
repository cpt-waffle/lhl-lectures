## The Dev Workflow

### Tools you are using

- vscode ( any coding editor )
- terminal ()
```sh
ls # list directory
cd # change directy
cd . 
cd ..
mkdir folder_name
touch file.js
rm file.txt 
rm -r /folder_name
```
- git

git is a tool that helps you keep track of changes you make for every and any file. 
lets you make snapshots of files that you have created and worked upon.

you write some code, its really good code  (it works :) )
you add more things to that code, and its now not working correctly :(
you can use github to go back in time, to the original good working code.


to create a git repo

```sh
git init
```


to look at whats being untracked/tracked or any changes 

```sh
git status
```
