# What Causes Imposter Syndrome

## Personality Traits

### Being a Perfectionist

  Individuals who set excessively high standards for themselves and strive for perfection are more likely to experience imposter syndrome. They may feel that anything less than flawless performance is inadequate.


### Neuroticism

  People who are prone to anxiety, self-doubt, and negative emotions are more susceptible to feeling like imposters.

### Low Self-Esteem

  Individuals with low self-confidence and a poor self-image may struggle to internalize their successes and attribute them to their own abilities.


## Family Background

### Parenting Style

Overly critical or controlling parents can contribute to feelings of inadequacy in their children. Conversely, parents who excessively praise and protect their children may create unrealistic expectations of constant success.


### Sibling Comparison

Constant comparison with siblings, especially if one sibling is perceived as the "golden child," can lead to feelings of inferiority and self-doubt.

## Societal and Cultural Factors

Cultural Expectations: Societal norms and cultural expectations about success and competence can pressure individuals to meet unrealistic standards. This is particularly true in cultures that highly value achievement and status.

Discrimination and Stereotypes: Members of underrepresented or marginalized groups may experience imposter syndrome more acutely due to societal stereotypes and biases that question their abilities and legitimacy.

## Work Environment

### High-Pressure Workplaces
  Environments that emphasize competition and constant performance evaluation can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy.
### Lack of Representation
  In fields where there is a lack of diversity, individuals from underrepresented groups may feel like they don't belong, contributing to imposter syndrome.
### Imposterism Among Peers
 If imposter syndrome is prevalent among colleagues, it can create a culture where everyone feels like they are pretending, reinforcing the cycle of self-doubt.

 ## Achievements and New Roles

### Academic and Professional Achievements
  Paradoxically, achieving success can trigger imposter syndrome, as individuals may feel unprepared for new responsibilities or fear that they won’t be able to replicate their success.
### Transition Periods
  Starting a new job, receiving a promotion, or entering a prestigious program can amplify feelings of being an imposter as individuals navigate unfamiliar roles and expectations.


# Dealing with Imposter Syndrome


1. Acknowledge Your Feelings

Recognize and Accept: Understand that imposter syndrome is a common experience and that many successful people have similar feelings. Acknowledge your feelings without judgment.
Label the Feelings: Identify when you are experiencing imposter thoughts and label them as such. This helps in separating the feelings from reality.

2. Talk About It

Share Your Experiences: Open up to trusted friends, family members, mentors, or colleagues about your feelings. They can offer support and perspective.
Join Support Groups: Consider joining or forming a group where people can share their experiences with imposter syndrome. This can provide a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation.

3. Challenge Negative Thoughts

Cognitive Restructuring: Replace negative self-talk with positive affirmations. Challenge irrational beliefs by asking yourself for evidence that contradicts those thoughts.
Reframe Failures: View mistakes and failures as opportunities for learning and growth rather than as proof of inadequacy.

4. Document Your Achievements

Keep a Success Journal: Write down your accomplishments, positive feedback, and any successes, no matter how small. Reviewing this journal can help remind you of your capabilities.
Celebrate Milestones: Take time to celebrate your achievements and acknowledge your hard work and contributions.


5. Set Realistic Goals

Break Down Goals: Divide larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This makes it easier to see progress and reduces feelings of overwhelm.
Set Achievable Standards: Aim for excellence, not perfection. Understand that making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process.

6. Seek Feedback and Mentorship

Constructive Feedback: Ask for feedback from trusted sources to get a realistic assessment of your strengths and areas for improvement.
Find a Mentor: A mentor can provide guidance, support, and validation, helping you build confidence in your abilities.

7. Develop a Growth Mindset

Embrace Learning: Focus on continuous improvement and view challenges as opportunities to develop new skills.
Be Kind to Yourself: Practice self-compassion and treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer a friend.


8. Practice Self-Care

Stress Management: Engage in activities that reduce stress, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies you enjoy.
Healthy Lifestyle: Ensure you are getting enough sleep, eating well, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

9. Professional Help

Therapy or Counseling: Consider seeking help from a mental health professional if imposter syndrome is significantly impacting your well-being. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be particularly effective in addressing these issues.

10. Visualize Success

Positive Visualization: Imagine yourself succeeding and handling challenges effectively. Visualization can help build confidence and reduce anxiety.


# Dealing with Imposter Syndrome as a Dev


1. Usually imposter syndrome starts with gap in a technical knowledge

What do you feel is a gap you have in techincal knowledge currently?

2. Build something to try to learn about that missing "gap"

That does not mean build a big project. 
Enough to figure out the basics and built on top of it.

Make a fun project, break it down into chunks and complete each chunk.

It does not have to be PERFECT in any way.

3. Write a README of the project to explain what was done in the project and lessons learned

a good quick manual to your future self on what was the small project about and an example of how to use it.


4. If you can or have the opportunity, ask for feedback on something you built. 

refactoring, different point of view, different file structure, etc
Looking at a solution differently can open up more questions for discussion and understanding
