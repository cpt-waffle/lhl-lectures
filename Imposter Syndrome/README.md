## What is Imposter Syndrome

Feeling like a beginner
Believing your success is not earned well or deserved
fraud feeling
you know what you are doing but you feel like you dont know
Iâ€™m not able to do this like everyone else can
This is not meant for me

Happens in all aspects of every field in the world


# Symptoms of Impostor Syndrome

you constantly question your abilities and you fear that others will discover that you lack
those abilities and competence 

## Attribute success to other external Factors

you completed tinyapp, and i say "thats awesome" 
"the mentors did it for me" - someone
"I googled everything" - someone else
"I'm not going to remember any of this next week" - me

## Overworking 

feeling the need to work harder and longer than others to keep pace and prove one's worth


## Fear of Failure

Avoiding new challenges or opportunities, due to the fear of failure and being "found out"

## Discounting Praise

Having a hard time accepting feedback or praise, believing that feedback and sticking to your own beliefs (of failure)

## Comparing to Others

Frequently comarping oneself to others, and feeling inferior. Even when there is no basis for the comparison


# Types of Imposter Syndrome

### The Perfectionist

"everything has to be perfect, at 100%"
Set unrealistically high goals
either reach them (you feel was not the way to reach the goals) or fail to reach them
call yourself of failure for failing at it

Tinyapp

[] it could be refactored more
[] it could more tests for front/back 
[] it could use another piece of technology that is more popular with express (like TS, or React)


### The Expert

has a good knowledge on various topics, yet because they may not know the topic at 100%
they will convince themselves that they know nothing at all (expose themselves as frauds)

"I know that I know nothing"


### The Natural Genius
Thinks inteligence is an inherent skill. Learning should be quick, and easy, and painless.
If covering a subject, should only take you a few hours to know everything about it. 


### The Soloist
Prefers to work alone, and do everything themselves. They have a difficulty asking for help or collabrating 
with others because they fear of asking a "bad" question, and being exposed like they know nothing. 


### The Superhero

Need to be the best at every part of their life. Work, Hobbies, Family, etc. 
Juggle everything with maximum effort and produce substantial results.  They strive for perfection
not only in professional life but also their personal life as well.

They also get burned out quite quickly because of the pressure to maintain an image of being the best and somewhat "invinsible"

## Dealing with Imoposter Syndrome as A Dev

1. Imposter syndrome in a dev starts with a gap in a techinical knowledge.

What is your techincal knowledge gap?

- handling apis with frontend 
- prop passing and component reusing 
- issue with different "use" hooks that i've never used

2. Buld something to learn about this "missing gap"

- just seeing how it works 
- a full out project

keeping the project in small little pieces is a must!

it does not have to be PERFECT in any way!

2.5 -- what you do doesn't work out 
  - There are thousands of tutorials online 
    - pick a tutorial and do everything they do to a letter exactly the same to get the exact same
    same result in video/tutorial
  - get someone to review your code, and you give advice ( throw the thing into chatgpt ask it to be reviwed tell it the problem )

3. 
If everything worked and it runs

- get someone to review your code.
- write a README of the thing/project/code piece you did. Explain and show the example of what it does. 


3.5 
If you have time, do a quick refactor, and try to rebuilt in again.
