# ---------------------------------

### Why do We test !

- less bugs in prod
- write expected behaviour
- keep our codebase with less bugs and more tests, so we can run tests quite quickly

25 features = 1  feature per minute to test manually
25 features = 1 min to write test, and to run a test it takes around .5 sec
