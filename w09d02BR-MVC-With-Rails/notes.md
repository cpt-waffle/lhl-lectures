### Agenda ###

- going over the MVC in ruby on rails
- creating a small project with all of the MVC patterns



## Rails and Express

- configuration vs convention


## The most important file in ruby on rails (my opinion!)



Controllers

A file that is responsible for the logic of your routes
`catsRoutes.js`
