### Back in the Day...

2004-2008

- Giant 17-19 inch monitors CRTs
- LCD screens 17-19 squares 

- Iphone 1 announced
- Every app showed on iphone 
- they used another iphone!
- pinch to zoom !
- watch youtube !


### Support for smaller screens or different size of screen in general

Why don't we detect what device they are using on a request....
and give back a website/view for that SPECIFIC device as a response...
