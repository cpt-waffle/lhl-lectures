## Responsive Design

What that means ?  How far have we come!


---- Viewport 
---- rem em pixel percentages
---- breakpoints/media queries
---- flexbox with breakpoints
---- sass (bonus)


## The old Days 


- 2000 - 2010 
- CRTC Monitors, LCD square moniotrs would come out
- 24 inch  average 20 inch or lower 

## IPhone 1 Came out 

- We need run on a phone!?!

How can we get around this at the time....

What if... we detect the screensize on request
and respond back with a different webpage....

(req,res) => {
  sizeOfScreen,
  device, 
}
