### React 

Server Side vs Client Side

- Server Side: TinyApp

The backend server builds the UI for the user. 
Server ==============================RES===================> Client
EJS -------------------------TRANSFORMED--------------------> HTML

### Client Side Rendering 

- Tweeter

we have another server hosting up ONLY THE CLIENT SIDE ( UI ) for the client


## LightBNB

--> the entire app was built like a client side rendering application
where ALL OF The FRONT END JS FILES would make the layouts/pages.


### React 

a server that hosts up only the front-end part of your app ( no database connections)
(no routes for data) 

it is built by only using "javascript files" and "css"

html, js, css
