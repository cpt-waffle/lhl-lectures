### Why do we Write/need/Want Tests in code?

- so to test if the code is running
- its working or not
- reduce mental load 
- working as intented 
- figure out what scenarios are tested ( happy path vs Edge cases vs sad path )
- other changes that you may not consider effect the overall code 

- writing tests makes things faster, (Faster development,)

### TDD -- Test Driven Development

- you think of/ write the tests first ( and alittle bit of code to run those tests)
- run the tests, they fail :(
- write the code to pass each test
- once all tests pass, feature complete :)
