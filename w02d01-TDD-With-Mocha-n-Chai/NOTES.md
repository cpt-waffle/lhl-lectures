### Why do we want to test our code? Why do we even care about testing?

- makes code predictible
- automated testing helps with code grwoth
- to make sure our logic transate dto code correctly
- readability 
- save time / save money $

### Does Testing Save Time ?

in a long run YES, in a short run, not really :(


### TDD -  Test Driven Development

- you have a feature that you need to implement
- you want to write enough code to compile the feature ( the feature will crash)
- you write your tests
- all tests fail :(
- write your feature and makes sure it starts passing each test
- all tests pass :)
