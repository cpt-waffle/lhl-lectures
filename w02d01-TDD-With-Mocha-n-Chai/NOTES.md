- TDD Talk
- module exports
- TTD built in methods (console.assert)
- Mocha and Chai talk
- Testing With Mocha Chai
---------------------------------------

## Why would you write Tests for Coding?

- find bugs
- to save time 
- avoid as many updates after the program has been released as possible
- so others can test if their changes break the code

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

- you write your test first* (and alittle code so that the tests run)
- they all fail 
- and you write code, slowly, to pass every single test you wrote 
- move on to the next task, feature, fix, etc

### Palindrome

it takes a string, and checks if the string is the same thing backwards
Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome but we we will 
TDD for this approach.
