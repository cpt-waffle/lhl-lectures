 ---- Agenda ----

- TDD Talk
- TTD built in methods (console.assert)
- module exports
- Mocha and Chai talk
- Testing With Mocha Chai

### Why do we write/care/need/want Tests in our code/repo/libraries ??

- checks for bugs 
- make sure we pass edge cases and no errors on those edge cases
- for accuracy in our code
- check if code works in a safe enviroment, then use it in a real scenario/repo


### Tests Save us Time ?

in the long time yes, in the short time, not really :(



### TDD -- Test Driven Development

- you have feature, that you need to implement
- you write just enough code to compile the feature
- you write tests (every and all tests you can think of!)
- all your tests will fail :(
- write code to pass each tests until all are passed
- all tests pass == feature compelete
