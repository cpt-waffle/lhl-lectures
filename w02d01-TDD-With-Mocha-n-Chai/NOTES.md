 ---- Agenda ----

- TDD Talk
- TTD built in methods (console.assert)
- module exports
- Mocha and Chai talk
- Testing With Mocha Chai

### Why do we even want to write test code ?


- saves time 
- writting actual code easier 
- debugging a bit easier
- documentation 
- make code predictable

### Does it really save time 

Writting tests means that you write more code:

and more code, means you will use more time

each test can be ran in a couple of seconds or less than a second


### TDD - Test Driven Development

- you have to write a feature for implementation
- you write the testing code first, with all expect results, and outputs and inputs, etc
- you write alittle bit of your feature just so it can run the tests
- every test should fail :(
- write your feature to start passing each and every test
- all tests pass :)
- feature is complete !
