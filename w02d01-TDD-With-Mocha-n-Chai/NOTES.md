- TDD Talk
- TTD built in methods (console.assert)
- module exports
- Mocha and Chai talk
- Testing With Mocha Chai

## Why Do we Write/Need/Want Tests in Code???

- saves us a ton of time!
- to ensure our code is working 
- expectations (working code must do some functionality)
- edge cases testing 
- to catch bugs early 
- code complexity, easier tests


`2 x amount of code = more time used we waste more time writting tests?`

-- Even thought it takes more time to write tests, 
eventually, you will be able to run all the tests on all the features
in a few seconds, which will save you ALOT of time!!!


## TDD -- Test Driven Development

- you think of/ write the tests first*  (alittle of code so taht the tests run)
- run em, make sure they all fail :(
- write code to pass the tests
- once all the tests pass, == feature is complete


## Coding Time!
