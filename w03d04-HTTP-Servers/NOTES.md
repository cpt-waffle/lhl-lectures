### Passwords

plain text passwords should not be stored, because they can be used maliciously

NEVER STORE PLAIN TEXT PASSWORDS !!

### Hashing

string/text --------> algo -------> salt ----------> 20-39i4kr0sp9i50923u5rospijf2035j0wjr029u34509

hashing is one way, and cannot be reversed

### bcrypt/bcryptJS

bcrypt is written in C      --> so its very fast!!
bcryptJS is written in JS   --> pretty slow :(
