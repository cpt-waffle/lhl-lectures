### Theory of Why we need Databases

- imagine TinyApp was deployed, to a real server thatt users can access
- this app blew up in user activity
- you have become a billionare !!!
- users demand new features
- make those demand features (user groups, analytics, dark mode, etc)
- features all the features
- deploy the features out to the server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
restart your node server
urlsDatabase { {}, {} }
usersDatabase { {}, {} }

-- Maybe i can use a file to store my data..
.csv 

id,   shor_url, long_url, user_id


### Postgres

-- Service, thats able to be hosted on multiple machines,
that can be accessed by anyone/anything that have the credentials
