### What is React to You?

 - front-end dev tool
 - JS Library
 - it makes it easier for teams to work on it 
 - UI dynamic render
 - UI build/interactivity
 - Build parts in isolation 

### If its simular to building apps like we used to, then why do we learn it?

- byitself, react is a client side rendering app ( exactly like tweeter )
- server-side vs client-side  ===> 
   --- server-side sends HTML/CSS/JS per request, 
   --- client-side sends a very basic HTML/JS/CSS and all the data gets sent out afterwards 
     by request of the client

  --- if information is behind a login-portal ( doesn't need to be SEO'd/scraped ) React-app is going to do good
  --- if you need to be shown on google, you should do a server-side rending app
