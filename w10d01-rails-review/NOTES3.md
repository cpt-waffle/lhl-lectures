### Express vs Rails

## Express 

Configuration
 - make routes
 - gave routes names ( any name you wanted )
 - specified what you wanted to render
 - you made logic files, helpers, with any name, with an folder structure
 - you added PG node_module, you installed, and configured it

 ## Rails

 Convention
 - used generators

 - follow folder convention
 - follow views convention 
 - etc 
 - rails does alot of work behind the scenes
