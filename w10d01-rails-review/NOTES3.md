## Rails vs Express

## Convention vs Configuration

- Rules that you have to follow
- Config things, 


### Express

- you configure EVERYTHING
- making routes, adding database, creating anyfilename as a helper, requiring it in specific files, adding services (twillio). 


### Rails 

- will make you ALOT of the things, already configured, but you have to use its, generator
- naming conventions for files 
- naming conventions for views
- naming conventions for folders
- rails does alot of work, behind the scenes.......
